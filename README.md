# Remote Desktop Emulator

Here's a link to the tool: https://github.com/prasethu/RemoteDesktopEmulator/releases

* Launch the tool
* Select the monitor configuration (number of monitors, DPI for each of them) you'd like to try out
* Hit Connect
* A remote desktop connection prompt will be displayed. Connect to the machine where you'd like this configuration to be setup

<b>Note:</b> The tool makes changes to your registry so the Remote Desktop Connection app on windows can read the monitor configuration, so any further sessions while this tool is running will have this monitor configuration. 

When you are done using the tool, close it and your original remote desktop session will be restored.
